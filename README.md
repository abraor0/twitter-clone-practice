# Twitter clone

## Goal
After reaching a certain stage in the react course I'm taking, I decided it was time to build something without following any specific tutorials to help solidify all the concepts I have learned up to this point. I ended up choosing a clone-type project to avoid spending time thinking about the design, and twitter specifically because I use it daily.

## Using
- React
- Tailwind
- React Router
- Firebase
